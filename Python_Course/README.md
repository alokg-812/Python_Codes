## Why Programming???
*Ans:* Language needed to be learnt to communicate with computer.


## Why Python only???
*Ans:* Beacause python is very widely spoken, easy to understand and very powerful language.

### Ex-
```
print("Hello")
```
**Output:** 
```
Hello
```
### Ex-
```
print("*")
print("**")
print("***")
print("****")
print("*****")
```
**Output:** 
```
*
**
***
****
*****
```

#### Is it possible to print multiple statements in a same print statement???
**Ans:**
100% __Yes__ we can do that as the following way:
```
print("Hello India", "Hello Madrasians")
```
**Output:**
```
Hello India, Hello Madrasians
```
>[!NOTE]
>* We can use multiple statements while printing them.
>* Only **()** are allowed to print statements.
>* We can print anything we want to inside the "" thing.
>* If want to print any type of number, be it whole number or any decimal number, they are not written inside these " ".

## Variables:
Variables are containers on RAM used to store data values.
Ex:
```
x = 10
y = "Hello India"
```
**Explanation:**
- x is storing the integer value 10.
- y is storing the string value "Hello India".
Ex:
```
age = 10
Age = 12
name = "Alok"
print(age)
print(Age)
print(name)
```
**Ouput:**
```
10
12
Alok
```
**Explanation:**
- age, Age & name are storing the values
  
>[!TIP]
>* Variables should have _meaningful_ names.
>* Python is case-sensitive, so Age and age are different variables.

## Input Taking:
_Ans:_ We can take input from the user using the **input()** function.

Ex:
```
name = input("Enter your name: ")
print("Hello", name)
```
**Output:**
```
Enter your name: Alok
Hello Alok
```
>[!Note]
>If taking input, the input's default type would be **string.**
